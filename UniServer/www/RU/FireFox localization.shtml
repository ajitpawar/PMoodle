Portable
in Other Languages</h2>
<p>This page explains how to get Firefox Portable localized to
your language
of choice. By default, Firefox Portable ships with English (US) as its
language, as that is what I build it from.
There are 2 methods to getting Firefox Portable to appear in your
locale:</p>
<h2>Method 1: Copy it right in</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Firefox Portable in your own language
is to
simply copy a local installation of Firefox (in your prefered language)
into Portable Firefox. To do this:</p>
<ol><li>Install Firefox Portable to your portable device as
outlined on the support page</li><li>Delete all the files
within the FirefoxPortable\App\firefox\ directory</li><li>Copy
your local Firefox files to that same directory (you can usually find
them in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\ ).</li><li>Use
Firefox Portable as normal</li></ol>
<p>You now have Firefox Portable in your own language. Messages
from
the launcher will still be in English (Ex: Another copy of Firefox is
running...). This will be resolved in a future release.</p>
<h2>Method 2: Language Packs and Locale Switcher</h2>
<p>The second method is useful if you wish to be able to switch
languages on a regular basis. Here are the steps.</p>
<ol><li>Unzip Firefox Portable to your portable drive</li><li>Start
Firefox Portable</li><li>Download the <a target="_top" href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/switch-locales/">Locale-Switcher</a>
extension and then install it by doing a FILE - OPEN within Firefox
Portable.</li><li>Download the <a target="_top" href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable/localization#language_packs">language
pack</a> you'd like to use and install it using the same method.</li><li>Close
Firefox Portable, wait for it to stop writing to your drive, and then
restart it to complete installation of the extensions.</li><li>Head
to TOOLS and the LANGUAGES and select the language you which to switch
to.</li><li>Restart Firefox Portable for the change to take
effect (being sure it has fully closed before restarting).</li></ol>
<p>Now, this method works pretty well and should work for just
about everyone. The advantage is that this is a bit
cleaner and you can easily switch between multiple languages. The
disadvantage is that if your drop a local profile
into Firefox Portable, you'll need to perform these steps again.</p>
