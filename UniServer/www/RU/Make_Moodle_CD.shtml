to Make a new Moodle CD</h2>There
are several steps to make a new Moodle CD containing your own courses.<br>There
are two modes of operation. <b>CD mode</b> and <b>US
mode</b>(user mode). You must be in <b>US mode</b>
to make changes to Moodle. You must be in <b>CD mode</b>
to make a new CD. Follow the steps below to make a new Moodle CD.<br><br><b>Install
Moodle</b><br>If
you want to make a new CD you must first install moodle to your hard
disk drive. There is a link on the control panel menu to do this.<br>When
you receive the CD it will start by itself if possible. It can only
start by itself if autostart is enabled for the CD drive in your
computer. When it starts it will be in CD mode. In this mode things
added to moodle are stored on the hard disk of the computer in a folder
named C:\uscd35temp. These additions to moodle will be lost if a new CD
is made.<br>The install will copy moodle to C:\UniServer
on your hard disk. From there you can start moodle by running
Server_Start.bat.<br><br><b>Make
Changes to Moodle</b><br>When
you have installed moodle on the hard disk you can add new courses or
make whatever other changes you want. Before you make a new CD you must
return to the CD mode. The CD you make will not work if you do not do
this.<br><br><b>Change to CD Mode</b><br>To
change to CD mode you must run <b>C:\Uniserver\mode_cd.bat</b><br><br><b>Make
the new Moodle CD</b><br>After
you have done this you can make a new CD. There is a CD making software
called Deepburner on the original CD. You can use this software to make
the new CD. If you have your own software to make CD's you can use
that. To make the CD copy the files from C:\UniServer
on your hard disk to the CD.<br><br><b>Change Moodle
back to US Mode</b><br>You should change Moodle back to the
US mode. This will make it easier to make more changes later.<br>Follow
the steps below...<br>Run <b>C:\Uniserver\mode_us.bat</b><br>You
do not have to shut down the server. The <b>mode_us.bat</b>
command will do everything for you.</td> </tr> </tbody></table></div></body></html>
