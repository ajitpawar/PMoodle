&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">PStart
Menu</span>- The box menu that stays open to the right of your page and&nbsp;on the icon bar at bottom right of your screen. The followoing
buttons are listed on the PStart menu. This menu controls everything
related to Portable Moodle. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Start</span><br><br>This will launch you to the start page. Once in the start page you must use the link that reads <a target="_top" href="http://localhost:4001/moodle/index.php">Click
Here to
Enter Moodle and &nbsp;Your Course </a>&nbsp;which
will start moodle. If you have another Firefox window open you will be
prompted to close that window then you must again click on "Start" from
the PStart menu. &nbsp;The flags on the menu will take you to the start
page in the particular language represented. These pages are place
holders right now they have not been interpreted. When you get into
moodle
the password is "password" the username is "Admin".<br><br><br><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Stop Save</span> <br><br>This
will stop the&nbsp;software engine save your course&nbsp;work and
disable&nbsp;moodle although it doesn't &nbsp;kill the Portable Firefox
browser window. One can stop&nbsp;the software engine but still
see the&nbsp;last viewed Portable Firefox browser page. If you use
either of the menu stop choices the PStart menu will go away but you
might still see a little round button on the bottom tool bar. This is a
bug sometimes you might see more than one button on the bar but if you
try to click on it then it disappears. <br><br>Alternatively you could kill
&nbsp;the Portable Firefox
&nbsp;browser and not kill the software engine.Therefore if you killed
the Firefox Portable browser and wanted to get back to start page and
then moodle you would need to double ctick "Start" from the Pstart menu
again or launch your browser and go back to that particular page in
browser history. Addtionally if the software engine is still alive and
you click on the little round button on the bottom tool bar area it
will reappear at the right of your screen. <br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Stop Delete</span> </span><br><br>Same
as Stop and Save. The only difference is this will permanently delete
your work&nbsp; from c:\uscd35temp and it will be unrecoverable if you are in
CD Mode. If you are in read and write mode (r/w) it will delete your
work but not necessarily&nbsp; permanently. Moodle however will
still be functional in both cases minus any course work not stored in
database. Content that has been added using&nbsp; programs outside
of&nbsp; moodle&nbsp; will be deleted such as flash files and data,
pictures, word documents, powerpoints basically anything that has been
stored in the /moodledata directory.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Install to USB/HDD</span><br><br>This
installs to any writeable media that is recognized by Windows. &nbsp;By
default it installs to C:\pm1.20 but you can change it to fit your
needs. The install uses approximately 135 mb of space. In order to make
it smaller we
had to take off much of the free developer software. So if you want to
distribute with the developer software intact you wouldn't want to use
this method. If you install with this method you must remember where
the \pm1.20 directory exists in order to perform a complete delete. To
perform a <span style="font-weight: bold;">complete delete</span>&nbsp;you must double click "stop and delete" on PStart menu and
delete the ..\System diretory. If you delete the \System directory&nbsp;
moodle <span style="font-weight: bold;">will not</span> be functional until you either reinsert your CD ROM and
run the install again or restore from a backup. Unless you had another
backup&nbsp;all the&nbsp;user added content will be lost. The "Stop Delete"
button&nbsp;does not delete Moodle or courses in Moodle it only
deletes most user contributed content.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Important Note</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Moodle
stores data in two places /moodledata directory and in the database.
Deleting /moodledata doesn't gaurantee removal of all user contributed
content !</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep backups of your courses at all times</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">different media</span>. <br><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>Autorun Note:</span><br><br>Autorun
doesn't work from the \pm1.20 directory although START.BAT will work regardless of location of directory.You must double
click START.BAT to get things going if autorun is not in the root. So
for any media you desire to autorun from&nbsp; you must copy the
contents of pm1.20 directly to root of the&nbsp;media ie...USB stick or
external drive.&nbsp; Therefore you will not have the directory
\,pm1.20 instead you will simply have four files listed including
START.BAT and one directory named "System". <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>Additonally
autorun must be enabled, configured and functioning on that particular
computer. If autorun doesn't work just double click START.BAT. <br><br><br style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Faster navigation in CD Mode</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">. </span>When
you click on the breadcrumb links provided&nbsp; inside of moodle
&nbsp;you force a read from the CD ROM which could be slow or very slow
depending on the speed of your CD ROM. There are times when you must
click on these links. However if you've already gone forward to a point
and want to go back you are&nbsp;much better off using the back arrow
in Portable Firefox. So as a rule of thumb for faster navigation use
the "Forward" and "Back" arrows when possible. <br><br>If you cannot
live with the speed running from CD ROM install to a faster writeable
media which will significantly &nbsp;lower response time. <br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Start icons are not the same</span>.
We made the start icons on PStart menu different to indicate the mode.
If you see the icon that looks like a CD ROM that means you
are in CD mode. If you are in the one that looks like a&nbsp; hard
disk drive then you are in user mode or read/write mode. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
