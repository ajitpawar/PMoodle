<h2><a name="installing"></a>Installing
Firefox Portable</h2>
<p>To install Firefox Portable, just download the portable
package at
the top of the Firefox Portable page and then double-click it. Select
the location you wish to install to and click OK. A FirefoxPortable
directory will be created there and all the necessary files installed.
That's all there is to it.</p>
<h2><a name="using"></a>Using Firefox Portable</h2>
<p>To start up Firefox Portable, just double-click
FirefoxPortable.exe file where you installed Portable
Firefox on your portable drive. Then, use it just like you would a
local copy of Firefox. There are a
couple of things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul><li>Stay Safe - When using portable apps, it's always a
good idea to practice <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/useful_stuff/safe_portable_app-ing/">Safe
Portable App-ing</a>.</li><li>Removing Your Drive -
When you're done, exit Firefox and then wait for the activity light on
your removable drive to stop flashing. This may take a minute or more
on slow drives or computers. Then select the 'Safely remove [device]'
option from the icon in the system tray. If you remove the drive while
it is writing, you may lose data.</li></ul>
<h2><a name="upgrading"></a>Upgrading Firefox
Portable</h2>
<p>To upgrade to a newer version of Firefox Portable, just
install a
new copy of Firefox Portable right over your old one. All your data
will be preserved.</p>
<p>If you're upgrading from Portable Firefox (older name and
directories), make a copy of your existing profile folder within the
PortableFirefox\Data\profile directory on your portable drive. Then
download the new version of Firefox Portable and copy your profile from
the old version into the new version within
FirefoxPortable\Data\profile. If you added any plugins or
searchplugins, you should copy those directories as well
(PortableFirefox\plugins to FirefoxPortable\Data\plugins and
PortableFirefox\firefox\searchplugins to
FirefoxPortable\App\firefox\searchplugins).</p>
<h2><a name="local_profile"></a>Copying Your
Local Firefox Settings</h2>
<p>If you're using a local copy of Firefox, you may wish to just
copy
your local Firefox settings right into Firefox Portable. Your local
Firefox profile is usually installed in C:\Documents and
Settings\[user]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\default.???\
Just copy the contents of that folder (except the cache directories) to
the FirefoxPortable\Data\profile directory. Then, and this is
important, delete the file FirefoxPortableSettings.ini within the
FirefoxPortable\Data\settings directory, if there is one. When you
start Firefox Portable for the first time, it's recommended that you
turn off disk cache, password saving and history if you're using a
flash-based portable device. You can set all of these within the
Privacy tab of the Firefox Options window. Sometimes, certain profiles
will cause the launcher to fail or hang. It's best to give it a few
minutes to see if it's just checking compatiblity and adjusting the
locations of the extensions before giving up on it. If it fails, it is
usually due to an incompatible extension.</p>
<h2><a name="plugins"></a>Installing Plugins
(Flash, Shockwave, etc.)</h2>
<p>With Firefox Portable, plugins work a bit differently than
they do
in regular Firefox. Here's how to do some of the most common plugins:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Flash Plugin</strong> - To
install Flash, follow these steps: <ol><li>Flash is
available <a href="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/xpi/current/flashplayer-win.xpi">as
an extension</a>. Just click the link.</li><li>You'll
probably see a yellow bar across the top of the browser (if not, skip
to Step 5), on that bar, click Edit Options</li><li>In the
popup window, click Allow to add PortableApps.com to your whitelist and
then click close</li><li>Now try the link again</li><li>You'll
see a popup asking if you would like to install, click OK after the
countdown and follow along the prompts</li></ol> </li><li><strong>Shockwave
Plugin</strong> - To install Shockwave, follow these steps: <ol><li>Download
the free <a href="http://sdc.shockwave.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?">Shockwave
Player</a> from the Macromedia website</li><li>Run
the installation routine and, instead of letting it install to a local
browser, select to choose your browser</li><li>Browse to
X:\FirefoxPortable\App\firefox (where X is your device's driver letter)
and continue with the installation</li><li>You may need to
restart Firefox Portable for the changes to take effect</li></ol>
</li><li><strong>Other Plugins</strong> - Other
plugin directions are coming soon...</li></ul>
<p><b>If the above fails, try the alternate (and more
geeky) method:</b></p>
<ol><li>Install the plugin in a local copy of Firefox (on
your hard drive)</li><li>Locate your plugins directory
(usually C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins\)</li><li>Copy
the plugin you need from there to your
FirefoxPortable\Data\plugins directory (Some Exmaples: For Flash, copy
NPSWF32.dll... for Shockwave, copy np32dsw.dll)</li></ol>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: It should be noted that
Adobe Flash does
*not* officially support running in any portable configuration. And, as
it is a closed source application, we can neither modify it nor package
it into a more portable-friendly installer. It should also be noted
that it is illegal to redistribute either flash or shockwave without
the full installer.</p>
<h2><a name="helper_apps"></a>Configuring
Helper Apps (PDF reader, document viewers, etc)</h2>
<p>Firefox Portable supports the ability to set other portable
apps as
helper apps to handle additional document types even as you move
between PCs. So, you can set Sumatra PDF Portable as your PDF viewer,
OpenOffice.org Portable as your DOC opener and VLC Media Player
Portable as your AVI handler and it will all work as you move to other
PCs.</p>
<p>The setting to do this in Firefox Portable works just like it
does in a regular install of Firefox:</p>
<ol><li>Click Tools and then Options from the menu</li><li>Select
the Content tab</li><li>Within the File Types section,
click the Manage button</li><li>In the list of types,
select the one you wish to edit and click the
Change Action button (if you don't see the type you want, see the note
below)</li><li>Select the "Open them with this application"
radio button and then click Browse</li><li>Select the
portable app you'd like to open this file type with (example:
SumatraPortable.exe)</li><li>Click Ok. Click Close. And
click OK to close all the windows.</li></ol>
<p>Now, when you click on a file of that type in Firefox, it will
open
it in the portable app you selected. The PortabableApps.com Launcher
takes care of any needed changes as you move between PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you don't see the file
type you'd like in
the list of file types, that means Firefox doesn't know about it yet.
Just search for a file of that type in Firefox and click on it. It'll
either ask you what you'd like to open it with (in which case, just
select the portable app you'd like to use) or it will automatically
associate it with an application or plugin installed on the local PC.
At that point, you can then follow the instructions above to tell
Firefox to use a portable app to open that type of file.</p>
<p><strong>Mailto Note</strong>: Mailto links are not
controlled by
Firefox's mimetypes setup, so this has no effect on being able to click
on an email link and launching Thunderbird. Firefox simply passes
mailto links to Windows and has it open the default mail client.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Note</strong>: When Firefox hands
off a file to
another application, it will usually store that file in the local PC's
TEMP directory. This file may be left behind after you close Firefox
Portable.</p>
<h2><a name="performance"></a>Improving
Firefox Portable's Performance</h2>
<p>Firefox Portable runs quite well from faster flash drives (and
portable hard drives or iPods) when connected to a USB 2.0 port. But
what if your flash drive is a bit below average speed-wise (and just
because it says "USB 2.0" on it, doesn't mean it's fast)? Or what if
you're stuck connecting to USB 1.1 ports at work or school? Well, there
are a few ways to improve performance.</p>
<p>First off, it helps to realize why things are slow. Firefox
Portable
has to read and write bits of data to and from your portable device
while it's running. On most flash drives, every time something is
written, all reads stop. When this happens, Firefox Portable can appear
to "freeze" or "hesitate" momentarily. Add to this the fact that most
flash drives aren't as fast as they promise. They all say "USB 2.0 high
speed" on them, but they're actually limited by the speed of the memory
chips inside them and the controller chip that handles communication
between those chips and a PC. There's about a 40x speed difference
between a slow drive and a fast drive when dealing with writing small
amounts of data. And, even if a drive can write a 5mb MP3 file quickly,
it may be slow with writing lots of tiny files.</p>
<p>Here's a list of different things you can do to speed things
up:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Disable Cache, History and Form Saving</strong>
- Cache is
disabled by default. In newer releases of Firefox Portable, history and
form saving are enabled. You can disable these within the Options
window.</li><li><strong>Disable Session Restore /
Undo Close Tab</strong> - Firefox
2.0 introduced a new feature called session restore. It keeps track of
all your open windows and tabs and can restore your session if Firefox
should crash. While a handy feature, it does have the unfortunate side
effect of writing to disk on every page load, which slows down Firefox
Portable. There's no option to disable it in the usual Tools - Options
windows, but you can disable it manually.
<ol><li>In Firefox's address bar, type in <strong>about:config</strong>
and then hit enter</li><li>Right-click on any entry and
select New - Boolean</li><li>For the name, enter
browser.sessionstore.enabled and click OK</li><li>Select
false and then click OK</li></ol>When you restart Firefox,
session restore (and undo close tab)
will be disabled and you should notice an improvement in browsing speed.</li><li><strong>Disable
Anti-Phishing</strong> - Firefox 2.0 comes bundled
with an anti-phishing filter that warns you of fake sites pretending to
be things like ebay and bank login pages. As with the ression restore,
though, it results in additional writes to the drive. This is
especially noticable in the first few minutes of using Firefox Portable
as it has to download the anti-phishing database and store it within
your profile (a 3mb+ file). You can disable this feature by clicking
Tools - Options and then selecting the Security tab. Uncheck the box
next to "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected forgery" and
then click OK. The anti-phishing filter is now off. If you'd like to
get back the space taken up by the database of forged sites, exit
Firefox Portable and then head to the FirefoxPortable\Data\profile
directory on your drive. Delete the urlclassifier2.sqlite file.</li></ul>
<h2><a name="proxies"></a>Configuring Proxies</h2>
<p>As you move between different computers, you may encounter
systems
on networks that use proxies and don't allow direct access to the
internet. You'll need to update Firefox Portable' connection settings
to use in the new environment. You can find these settings within Tools
- Options - General - Connection Settings. If you routinely use PCs
with different proxy settings (for example, work and home or work and
school), you can set up the options for both and easily switch between
them with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/125/">SwitchProxy
extension</a>. If you need to determine the connection settings
of the PC you are on to add to Firefox Portable, just run our <a href="http://portableapps.com/downloads/ProxyGet.exe">Proxy
Get Utility</a> and it will let you know what they are.</p>
<h2><a name="cd"></a>Running From a CD
(Firefox Portable Live)</h2>
<p>Firefox Portable supports running from a CD right out of the
box,
and it's a snap. Start off by downloading and installing Firefox
Portable to your hard drive... it doesn't matter where. Run it at least
once to generate the default settings. Then, customize it as needed,
being sure not to move FirefoxPortable.exe or any of the other critical
files. Next, download <a href="http://portableapps.com/downloads/app_extras/firefox_portable/live/FirefoxPortable.ini">FirefoxPortable.ini</a>
and save it to the same directory as FirefoxPortable.exe. Then, burn
the whole FirefoxPortable directory to a CD and you're ready to go.</p>
<p>If you use Firefox Portable from a USB flash drive with a
write-protect switch, you're covered, too. The Firefox Portable
Launcher will automatically detect when you protect the drive and offer
to run your files locally for you.</p>
<p>Additional information about the options in the INI is
provided in
the readme.txt file within the
FirefoxPortable\Other\FirefoxPortableSource directory. Please note that
you must follow Mozilla's Trademark Distribution Guidelines if you are
distributing your customized version to anyone else.</p>
<h2><a name="known_issues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
<p>The following are known issues with this package:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Trojan/Virus detected</strong>
- AntiVir and Avast, on more
than one occasion, have claimed there is a trojan or virus in the
launcher. This is due to poor detection in both products that will
occasionally mis-identify many NSIS-based applications as trojans. It
will usually occur after a definitions update. You should contact your
antivirus provider and let them know of their mistake. Do not contact
me about it as I am well aware of Avast and AntiVir's issues and can do
nothing to fix them. You can either wait for them to fix the issue
again
or switch to a better antivirus package.</li><li><strong>Renaming
FirefoxPortable.exe</strong> - Once on your
portable device, the launcher can be renamed to anything you'd like
except for firefox.exe. It tries to detect an existing instance of
Firefox so it doesn't just launch a new local one and if it is named
firefox.exe, it will detect itself.</li><li><strong>Themes
and Extensions</strong> - Most themes and extensions
should now work with Firefox Portable -- including those that make use
of the component registry. A handful will still fail, though. A few
things to keep in mind:
<ul><li>Some XPIs
must be downloaded to your PC before installing and then opened using
FILE and then OPEN (this is a limitation of Firefox, see <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262854">Bug
262854</a>).
If you can't easily download the XPI locally (like with the Google
Toolbar), simply enable your cache temporarily (Tools - Options -
Privacy - Cache - enter 1000 and click OK) and then install the
extension. Don't forget to disable the cache again after installing.
Oddly, <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/">addons.mozilla.org</a>
doesn't seem affected by this.</li></ul></li><li><strong>No
Portable Java</strong> - Sun's Java VM needs to be installed
locally as it makes a slew of registry entries, etc. There is no way to
make
it portable at present, so you will only be able to use Java-enabled
sites on machines that have the Sun Java VM installed locally.</li><li><strong>Read/Write
Required</strong> - Both the Firefox directory and the Profile
directory must be writeable on
the USB drive. Drives with a writable switch can not be in read-only
mode.</li><li><strong>Network Drives</strong> -
There has been a report that Microsoft patch <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/885250">MS051-011</a>
may break the ability to run applications from networked drives and
that Firefox Portable is affected.</li><li><strong>Non-ASCII
Character Directories Fail</strong> - Firefox Portable will not
function correctly when placed in a
directory containing non-ASCII characters. Firefox Portable's entire
path must be ASCII characters. The workaround is,
of course, to use an ASCII path for Firefox Portable. In a situation
where this is not possible (for example, when being placed
on a desktop of a non-English machine), you can set Firefox Portable to
run in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/appcompat.mspx#EBAA">Windows
98 compatibility mode</a> under
Windows XP. <em>(Thanks Wigaldlinger)</em></li></ul>
<h2><a name="modifications"></a>Modifications</h2>
<p>I made some modifications to the default version of Firefox
to make it more USB key friendly (decreasing the
number of writes to the drive, which will increase drive life). These
changes are listed here so you'll
know what they are, and so you can recreate the process, if so desired.
Obviously, you can change many of these settings
(ex cache, form saving or cookies disabled) by changing the options in
Firefox, but you will increase the number of writes to your
flash drive, thus decreasing its life.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Extension-Friendly Launcher</strong>
- Firefox Portable
Launcher
is included. It will alter the paths to any extensions you install to
work relatively and cleans up the bits Firefox leaves behind on the
local PC.</li><li><strong>Default Profile</strong>
- A default profile exists within the firefox directory.</li><li><strong>No
Default Browser Check</strong> - Firefox won't check to see if it
is the default browser on startup.</li><li><strong>Download
Prompt</strong> - Firefox will ask where to save downloads.</li><li><strong>Download
History Cleared</strong> - Download history is cleared on exit.</li><li><strong>Browser
History Disabled</strong> - The history has been disabled to
decrease disk size and the number of writes to the
disk, increasing disk life.</li><li><strong>Form Info
Saving Disabled</strong> - Information from forms is not saved.</li><li><strong>No
Disk Cache</strong> - The browser disk cache has been disabled to
decrease disk size and the number of writes to the
disk, increasing disk life.</li></ul>
