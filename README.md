PMoodle
=======

This is my final bachelor's degree project. It's just an attempt to develop a portable Moodle installation, which can be
easily copied to USB Memory Stick or hard drive without having to install/configure additional software, i.e. web server
and database.

The Details
-----------

This package contains preconfigured Uniform Server installation, including some portable apps such as Firefox and Foxit Reader.
To access Moodle, use the following credentials: username "admin" and password "Password123_". For MySQL default username "root"
and password "root".
- Apache 2.4.2
- MySQL 5.5.24-community
- PHP 5.4.3
- msmtp 1.4.27 - PHP Mail client
- Cron - Scheduler
- Firefox 13
- FoxitReader 5.3.0
