PMoodle
=======

This is my final bachelor's degree project. It's just an attempt to develop a portable Moodle installation, which can be easily copied to USB Memory Stick or hard drive without having to install/configure additional software, i.e. web server and database.

The Details
-----------

This package contains preconfigured Uniform Server installation, including some portable apps such as Firefox and Foxit Reader.
To access Moodle, use the following credentials: username "*admin*" and password "*m00dl3*". For student login use "*student*" and password "*testing*". For MySQL default username "*root*" and password "*root*".

- Apache 2.4.2
- MySQL 5.5.24-community
- PHP 5.4.3
- msmtp 1.4.27 - PHP Mail client
- Firefox 13
- FoxitReader 5.3.0
